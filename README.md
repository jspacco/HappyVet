Happy Vet is the busiest vet clinic in town. Everyday they have a lineup of regular health check-ups, however sometimes there are cases that require immediate action. Each vet at Happy Vet has their own tablet that lets them know who their next client is. The tablet has the name of the client, the type of visit needed, emergency or regular, and a description of the help needed. As long as there are no emergencies the vet will see that their next client is a regular health checkup. When there is an emergency they will have to take care of that case first before returning to the regular check-ups. If there is more than one emergency at a time each veterinarian will take the next case that is marked as an emergency before returning to the regular health checkups. If they fall behind on the emergencies then each vet will continue to take the oldest emergency available. If they fall behind on regular checkups they will finish the emergencies and then start in on the oldest regular checkup available.
